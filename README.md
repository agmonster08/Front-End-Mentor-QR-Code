### What I learned

Learned to practice using padding and margin, also setting the width of an image so it can be responsive. Learned also about
spacing like line height which makes a big difference on how things look even if it's so simple.




### Continued development

Would like to continue learning HTML & CSS as I'm trying to learn and improve, this challenges will sure help as watching tutorials it's not enough.
